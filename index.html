<h1>Gamer vs Non-Gamer Pointing Performance</h1>

<p>Author: Morgan Carpenter, Alexa Cherry</p>
<p>Summary: I tested the condition of a seasoned gamer vs someone who has as little experience as one could with video games. Both subjects were rested and ready, I tested myself as the gamer then Alexa as the non-gamer. I found that not only the speed for non was lower, but also the accuracy was much lower as well. </p>
